## Me

Working at [Bird Buddy](https://mybirdbuddy.com/) as Principal Engineer.

I have experiance in designing and building self healing, scalable and low maintanance architectures
as an Infrastructure Engineer as well as a Software Engineer. At Bird Buddy the _cloud_ manages
100.000's of IoT devices and processing more than 1M of images and videos per day.

I'm also interested in improving developer experiances, observability and in general automation of processes
to remove toil as much as possible.

I'm passionate about open source projects and communities. Interested in open web, open standards,
free software, decentralized technologies...

<p>
A social network created for an mmorpg game EVE Online. It was more of a playground to learn/improve web development, frontend and backend.
Interesting technologies used in this project are Redux, GRPC, Kuberentes, CI/CD Pipeline, Bazel, CQRS, Angular...
<br/>
Sadly never released, but it's still used in NestJS comunity as a referance project for others to see how larger projects look like using
the framework.

Opinionated Framework built on top of NestJS and TypeORM. Was built in paralle with New Eden Social.
Taken from that codebase to be introduced as a framework for others to use.
Lack of time, resulted in me abandening the project.

As the first "backend" employee i was in charge of designing and implementing architecture for the Bird Buddy product.

The mayor challenges about the product were the unreliability of IoT devices, processing live video streams and processing
images through inference detections.

The backend was ranging from the mobile app api to bird detection inference processing, iot device management as well as
other things like release process, observability and on-call etc.

During my time I have on-boarded all other backend and infrastructure engineers while building other aspects of the architecture.

Architecture designed was focusing on reliability, cost optimization and scalability.

__Reliability__ to take in to consideration that IoT devices are unreliable, especially outdoor devices due to poor wifi conditions.
__Cost Optimization__ due to being a hardware product, where each device sold adds aditional _perpetual_ cost to the cloud.
__Scalability__ as our successfull [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mybirdbuddy/bird-buddy-a-smart-bird-feeder)
caused that when we initialy started shipping the devices, we would be shiping them 10.000's of devices.
We did slow the release a bit, but due to the product offten being bought as a gift (Christmas),
meant that most of devices will be activated at the same day.
